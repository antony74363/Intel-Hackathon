This project is a web-based application that utilizes machine learning algorithms to assist in the diagnosis of three major health conditions: heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes. The application aims to provide users with preliminary assessments based on their input data, which can help them make informed decisions about seeking further medical evaluation.

Clone the repository:

Usage
Navigate to the web application in your browser.
Enter the required health data and symptoms into the provided fields.
Click on the "Diagnose" button to receive the preliminary diagnosis.
Review the results and suggested next steps.
Dataset
The machine learning models were trained using publicly available datasets, including:

Heart Disease Dataset: Heart_disease.csv
Parkinson's Disease Dataset: parkinson.csv
Diabetes Dataset: diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv

How It Works
The application uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the input data. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the workflow:

Data Collection: Users provide their health data through the web interface.
Data Processing: The application preprocesses the data for analysis.
Prediction: The preprocessed data is fed into the trained machine learning models to generate predictions.
Output: The application displays the predicted condition and recommendations based on the analysis.
